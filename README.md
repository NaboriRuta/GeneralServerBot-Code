# GeneralServerBot-Code
This is all of the code for my own Discord bot called GeneralServerBot, also known as GSB.

The needed node packages in node_modules and crucial information inside config.json are all missing, as it is either what should already be there or info that always needs to be kept secret.

I followed a YouTube tutorial for GSB by Imagine Gaming Play. Go check out his channel if you want to get started at: https://www.youtube.com/@ImagineGamingPlay
I also used official Discord.js documentation to help me write slash commands for GSB. If you want it all to work on the newest software, check out: https://www.discordjs.guide
